# Contributing

- you can suggest apps both via GitHub issues and pull requests, doesn't matter.
- when making a pull request: follow the existing structure, use similar formatting, use tags.
- don't add GTK 2 applications that don't have a working GTK 3 version in development!!
- don't add terrible applications
